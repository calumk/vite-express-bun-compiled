# Vue 3 + Vite + Bun + VFS!

This repository is a template for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [Bun](https://bun.sh/) + [VFS](https://bun.sh/docs/api/vfs) (Virtual File System)

It is a simple template to get you started with Vue 3 and Vite, using Bun as the package manager and VFS for file system operations.

It is designed to allow you to bundle your Vue 3 application with Vite and run it using Bun, while also providing a simple way to manage your files using VFS.

This allows a standalone application to be run without the need for a server, making it easy to deploy and share your application.
